# Pig Dice Game

## Overview

In this web-based dice game, two players take turns rolling a die and accumulating points. A player can choose to hold their score to secure it or continue rolling to add more points. However, if a player rolls a 1, their current round score is lost, and their turn ends. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
